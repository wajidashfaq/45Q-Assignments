//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just
//printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each 
//message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the 
//person’s name.

let frndNames: string[] = ["Manto", "Rehman", "Asher"]
let message: string = "Hey buddies! meet today at 11pm"
console.log(frndNames[0] + " " + message); 
console.log(frndNames[1] + " " + message);
console.log(frndNames[2] + " " + message);
